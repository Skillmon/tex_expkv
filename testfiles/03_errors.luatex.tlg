Runaway argument?
! expkv Error: unwanted value for `key2' in set `errors'
! Paragraph ended before \<an-expandable-macro>
completed due to above exception.  If the error
summary is  not comprehensible  see the package
documentation.
I will try to recover now.  If you're in inter-
active mode hit <return>  at the ? prompt and I
continue hoping recovery was complete.

I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.

TEST 2: errors during key definition
============================================================
! expkv Error: empty set name not allowed.
<argument> ...ssage {expkv Error: empty set name not allowed}
l. ...  }
This error message was generated by an \errmessage
command, so I can't give any explicit help.
Pretend that you're Hercule Poirot: Examine all clues,
and deduce the truth by order and method.
! expkv Error: empty key name not allowed.
<argument> ...ssage {expkv Error: empty key name not allowed}
l. ...  }
(That was another \errmessage.)
! expkv Error: empty set name not allowed.
<argument> ...ssage {expkv Error: empty set name not allowed}
